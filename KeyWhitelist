--- Note: This is a simple key whitelist ----
--- How to use this in your script: ---
**** BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING, CHANGE ("UseTheKeyFromTheKeyGeneratorIMade") to whatever you want your whitelist key to be ****
1) So basically, you put this above your script
2) Example: 

_G.Key = ""

if Key == "UseTheKeyFromTheKeyGeneratorIMade" then
 print("Loading Your Script")
 --- Put Your Loadstring here ---
else
 print("The key is not Correct!")
 print("Not loading your script!")
 game.Players.LocalPlayer:kick("Use the correct key")
end

(put your script that you want to add a whitelist to here)

3) Copy from where it says, "if Key == "UseTheKeyFromTheKeyGeneratorIMade" then" all the way to the end of your script.
4) DONT COPY (_G.Key = "")
5) Now obfuscate your script; I recommend using the PSU Obfuscator
6) Now, 
----------------------------------------------------------------
--- Script is below: ---

_G.Key = ""

if Key == "UseTheKeyFromTheKeyGeneratorIMade" then
 print("The Key is Correct!")
 print("Loading Your Script")
 --- Put Your Loadstring here ---
else
 print("The key is not Correct!")
 print("Not loading your script!")
end
